# Negative-Selection
Bio-Inspired Computing Project #2 - negative selection

##TODO
1) download KEGG formuala data & KEGG ID
2) link formula with chirality (use force chiral)
3) pick a subset of the chiral compounds - 25% of all chiral?
4) analyze frequencies of elements in chiral compounds (use abbreviations for two-letter elements, or find some way to split by capital letters?)
5) create a test set of the remainder of KEGG
6) use reverse frequencies (or smoothed frequencies, to match letters) to test chirality
7) profit
